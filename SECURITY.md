# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project:

1. **Do not** disclose the issue publicly until it has been reviewed.
2. Contact the maintainers at the dedicated security email: ing.ferraguti@gmail.com
3. Include a detailed description of the issue, steps to reproduce, and any potential impact.
4. Allow the team reasonable time to investigate and release a fix before public disclosure.

## Supported Versions

Only the latest main branch is actively supported with security fixes. Older versions may not receive patches.

## Security Best Practices

- Avoid committing secrets or sensitive data to the repository.
- Run automated dependency and vulnerability scans before releases.
- Keep dependencies up to date and follow least-privilege principles when configuring services.
